      <p><em><a href="https://indreams.me">Dreams</a></em> (Media Molecule, 2020) is one of the best games ever created. But to call it a game seems silly, since it defies categorization: it's game creation software, and a social network in which to share, play, and remix games.</p>

      <p>Pay attention to the remix word, as this is why the software is ahead of its time: almost everything in <em>Dreams</em> is created by players, and almost everything can be copied, remixed, and used at will. This includes music, sculptures, animations, paintings, sound effects, logic,... if it's in <em>Dreams</em>, you can probably remix it. This means that when you make a game in the software, you don't need to build everything by yourself. You automatically have access to an ever-expanding open source library of content. If you want to share what you've made, you can upload that creation to the cloud and others can use it too.</p>

      <p>I started exploring the software in May of 2020. I think the best way to learn any software is to make something with it, so I started making some short games with it. I expected that making 3-5 games would be enough to gain a solid understanding of the software. I made a virtual escape room, a 3D platformer about boats, a 2D platformer about cameras, and then <em>Color-by-buttons World</em>.</p> 

      <p>I had originally planned to make another 2D platformer based around manipulating gravity and release the 2D platformers as collection, but after releasing <em>Colour-by-buttons World</em> I felt that I had gained a detailed understanding of the software. I had also grown tired of creating new puzzles unrelated to mathematics, and I wanted to think directly about communicating mathematics instead. That lead me to create <a href="../Symbiosis/symbiosis-desc.html"><em>Symbiosis</em></a> the following year.</p>

      <p>As of September 2022, <em>Colour-by-buttons World</em> has been played by more than 5500 people for a collective time of more than a month &mdash; which is nice, considering it took me about a month to make! It was chosen by the developers of <em>Dreams</em> as a "Mm Pick", meaning Media Molecule considers the game one of the best on the platform.</p>
