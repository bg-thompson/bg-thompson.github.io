      <h3 id="chen">Matthew Chen (Spring 2022)</h3>
      <p>Matthew Chen studied game theory over the 2022 spring. We used the text <em><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262303767/game-theory/">Game Theory</a></em> by Fudenburg and Tirole, and covered most of parts I,II,III,IV. Some topics covered included: Nash equilibria, extensive-form games, repeated games, the purification theorem, mechanism design and the revelation principle.</p>

      <h3 id="tan">Sherrie Tan (Summer 2021, Summer 2020)</h3>
      <p>Sherrie Tan studied algebraic topology over the 2021 summer. We used notes from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107075418/http://sarah-whitehouse.staff.shef.ac.uk/MAS435/MAS435.html">Sarah Whitehouse's 2014-2015 algebraic topology course</a> (archived link). Topics included homotopy, exact sequences, and simplicial and singular homology. Sherrie gave a blackboard talk to other DRP students at the end of the project where she proved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer_fixed-point_theorem">Brouwer's fixed-point theorem</a> using homology.</p>

      <p>Sherrie Tan studied point set topology over the 2020 summer. We used the text <a href="http://www.topologywithouttears.net/"><em>Topology Without Tears</em></a> by Morris and covered the majority of the book. Highlights include proving the fundamental theorem of algebra and visualizing some 3-manifolds. Sherrie gave a brief talk to other DRP students towards the end of the project (<a href="sherrie-talk-2020.pdf">slides</a>).</p>

      <h3 id="polo">Brendan Polo (Spring 2021)</h3>
      <p>Brendan Polo studied elliptic curves during the spring. We used the text <a href="https://www.math.umd.edu/~lcw/ec.html"><em>Elliptic Curves: Number Theory and Cryptography, 2nd edition</em></a> by Washington, and covered the first four chapters of the book. Highlights included a proof of Pascal's Theorem using elliptic curves, as well as a proof of Hasse's theorem and applications to elliptic curves defined over finite fields.</p>

      <h3 id="guyett">Riley Guyett (Fall 2020)</h3>
      <p>Riley Guyett studied group theory during the fall. We used the text <a href="http://abstract.ups.edu/download.html"><em>Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications</em></a> by Judson et. al, and covered the first half of the book. Highlights included UPC code validation, applications of group theory to elementary number theory (Euler's Theorem, Fermat's Little Theorem), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA Cryptography</a>. Riley gave a brief talk to other DRP students at the end of the project about RSA (<a href="riley-talk-2020.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
