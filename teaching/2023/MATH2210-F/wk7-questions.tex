\subsection*{Question 1}
Let $a,b$ be two vectors in the Euclidean plane ($R^2$) which form angle $\theta$. Prove that
\[
a \cdot b = ||a|| \cdot ||b|| \cos \theta.
\]
where $||a||$ and $||b||$ are the lengths of $a,b$ respectively.

\subsection*{Question 2}
Let $T$ be a triangle in the Euclidean plane, and $a,b,c$ be vectors going from the origin to the corners of $T$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Express the centroid of $T$ in terms of $a,b,c$. (If you are unsure of the definition of the centroid of a triangle, check out the definition on Wikipedia.)
\item Let $L$ be a line passing through a corner of $T$ and its centroid. Let $L_1$ be the length of the line segments of $L$ going from the corner to the centroid, and let $L_2$ be the length of the line segment of $L$ going from the centroid to the side opposite the corner. Calculate the ratio $L_1:L_2$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Question 3}
Given two intesecting planes in Euclidean space ($R^3$), their smaller angle of intesection is called their \emph{dihedral angle}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the dihedral axis of the $xy$-plane and the $xz$-plane.
\item Imagine two adjacent faces of a tetrahedron as planes. Calculate their dihedral angle.
\item Prove that the dihedral angle of the tetrahedron (calculated above) are not a rational multiple of $\pi$.
\item Prove that a cube cannot be cut up into small pieces and reassembled to form a tetrahedron. (Check out the Wikipedia page of the Dehn invariant.)
\end{enumerate}
